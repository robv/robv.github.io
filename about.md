I’m Robert Velasquez, an almost 30-something that works in technology. I’ve started this blog with the hope of taking all of the loose ideas I have in my head and making sense of them. I’ve attempted to make writing a habit many a time but I hope that this time is different.

I currently work at BitTorrent Inc where I’m product manager for a new web browser we call Surf. I grew up in San Antonio, Texas and moved to San Francisco in 2010 where I’ve enjoyed various jobs in design and product.
